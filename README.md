Extra 10-2	Process lunch orders
In this exercise, you’ll complete a form that accepts a lunch order from the user and then calculates the order subtotal and total.
 
The application should provide for these main courses and add-ons:
Main course	Price	Add-on	Add-on price
Hamburger	6.95	Lettuce, tomato, and onions	.75
Ketchup, mustard, and mayo
French fries
Pizza	5.95	Pepperoni	.50
Sausage
Olives
Salad	4.95	Croutons	.25
Bacon bits
Bread sticks	
1.	Open the LunchOrder project in the Extra Exercises\Chapter 10\LunchOrder directory.
2.	Add three radio buttons to the Main Course group box, and set their properties so they appear as shown above. The Hamburger option should be selected by default.
3.	Add a group box for the add-on items. Then, add three check boxes to this group box as shown above. None of the check boxes should be selected by default.
4.	Code a method name ClearTotals that clears the three text boxes and a method named ClearAddOns that removes the check marks from the three check boxes.
5.	Code an event handler that changes the text that’s displayed for the Add-ons group box and the three check boxes when the user selects a different main course. This event handler should also remove the check marks from the add-ons and clear the order totals. Test the application to be sure this works correctly.
6.	Code an event handler that calculates and displays the subtotal, tax, and order total when the user clicks the Place Order button. The subtotal is the cost of the main course plus the cost of the add-ons. The tax is 7.75% of the subtotal. And the order total is the subtotal plus the tax. Test the application to be sure this works correctly.
7.	Code an event handler that clears the order totals when the user checks or unchecks an add-on. Then, test the application one more time.
